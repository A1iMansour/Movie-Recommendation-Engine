The optimization problem is approached through various formulations, including convex
optimization and matrix factorization methods. The challenges of high dimensionality and
computational complexity are addressed, leading to the development of a practical optimization
problem that involves stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The project encompasses data pre-
processing, optimization, evaluation, feature extraction, and fairness analysis, providing a
comprehensive exploration of recommendation system details.
